1. Cameron Neylon [Network Enabled Research: Maximise scale and connectivity, minimise friction](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/network-enabled-research/)

>Therefore the highest priority is building this network, making its parts and components interoperable, and making it as easy as possible to connect up networks that already exist. For an agency that funds research and seeks to ensure that research makes a difference the only course of action is to place the outputs of that research where they are most accessible on the network. In blunt terms that means three things: free at the point of access, technically interoperable with as many systems as possible, and free to use for any purpose. The key point is that at network scale the most important uses are statistically likely to be unexpected uses. We know we can’t predict the uses, or even success, of much research. That means we must position it so it can be used in unexpected ways.

Important background for the idea of network-enabled ressearch and the notion of unindented consequences (unexpected results in a positive ways).
