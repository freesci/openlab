1. Cameron Neylon [Network Enabled Research: Maximise scale and connectivity, minimise friction](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/network-enabled-research/)

>Therefore the highest priority is building this network, making its parts and components interoperable, and making it as easy as possible to connect up networks that already exist. For an agency that funds research and seeks to ensure that research makes a difference the only course of action is to place the outputs of that research where they are most accessible on the network. In blunt terms that means three things: free at the point of access, technically interoperable with as many systems as possible, and free to use for any purpose. The key point is that at network scale the most important uses are statistically likely to be unexpected uses. We know we can't predict the uses, or even success, of much research. That means we must position it so it can be used in unexpected ways.

Important background for the idea of network-enabled ressearch and the notion of unindented consequences (unexpected results in a positive ways). 

2. C. Titus Brown [Why I don't really practice open science](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html)

>This is a conundrum for open science: how do you know that someone else's work is worth your attention? Research is really hard, and it may take months or years to nail down all the details; do you really want to invest significant time or effort in someone else's research before that's done? And when they are done -- well, that's when they submit it for publication, so you might as well just read that first!

Titus touches on one of the most important issues of Open Science - resources management. Making all things open requires time and energy investment, yet still benefit of sharing ideas at the very early stage of development is unknown, and might be small if not nonexistent.
