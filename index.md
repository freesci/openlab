##Introduction

My name is [Pawel Szczesny](http://www.pawelszczesny.org/about/) and this is my research notebook. 

It serves a different role than my [blog](http://www.pawelszczesny.org). My blog contains rather defined and reworked ideas and texts, while this notebook is a dump of short notes, scraps of ideas and unorganized thoughts on the things that I am working on. Entries, while organized in chronological order, will be frequently updated (although full history is preserved, see below). 

The site is build with Jekyll and hosted on a private server, however full copy including history is [stored at Github](http://github.com/freesci/openlab). Github also stores source code of the stuff I've written along the course of doing research.

##How is this site organized?

Basic structure of the notebook reflects the categories on my blog. So:
* complex systems (biocomplexity) is a category containing notes on high-level description of biological complexity; it differs from systems biology, as it is more general and on the higher level
* bioinformatics - I'm working on different areas of bioinformatics: I analyze proteins, work in next generation sequencing (the focus is metagenomics) and develop small tools to capture evolutionary aspects of protein functionalities
* memetics - language is one of the limiting aspects of understanding the world; in general I'm more interested in capturing how acceptance of certain ideas develops in research community
* photography (visualization) - I'm interested in visualization and photography (especially using non-standard techniques, such as night or infrared photography)
* science 2.0 - this area covers all kinds of intersections between web technologies and science; openness is a main subject in here, even if it does not fit conceptually
* strategy -  another not so well described bucket; I'm more of a tactician than strategist (everybody is a strategist right now) and I'm not really interested in strategy (where to), but in tactics (how to)
* synthetic biology - this is high-level biological programming notebook
* systems biology - my main subject of research interest; in essence, I'm interested in understanding how complex organisms function, using systems biology modelling as a tool

Some entries will not fit into any of aforementioned categories, therefore they will have their own section called (of course) "dump".

Please remember that this is is still under heavy reconstruction. Some things might not work as expected.
